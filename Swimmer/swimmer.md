## Riddler Express

From Scott Cardell, a beach puzzle for your summer enjoyment:

*Two long-distance swimmers are standing on a beach, right on the water’s edge. They begin 100 yards away from one another on the shore, which is a straight line of sand. Both swimmers swim at exactly the same speed. Swimmer A heads straight out to sea, directly perpendicular to the shore. At the same time, Swimmer B also heads out, swimming exactly in the direction of Swimmer A at all times. Over time, Swimmer B will approach a position directly in Swimmer A’s wake, where he will follow her at a fixed distance.*

$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = a \\
\frac{d\theta}{dt} \\
\tan \theta_s = \frac{y}{100} \\
\theta_s = \arctan \left(\frac{y}{100} \right) \\
\theta_w = 19.47^{\circ}\\
\\\frac{d\theta_s}{dt} = \frac{1}{1 + (\frac{y}{100})^2}\frac{1}{100}\frac{dy}{dt}
$$
